            <p>
                JavaScript is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world right now. It's growing
                faster than<br />any other programmming language and big companies like Neflix, Walmart and Paypal built internal applications around
                javaScript.

                Here is  the average salary of a JavaScript developer in the US.<br />so, it's a great opportunity
                to get a good job out of learning JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>You can work as a Front-end developer, back-end developer or Full-stack developer.</p>

            <p>
                For a long time, javaScript was only used in browsers to build interative web pages but those days are gone<br />
                because of huge comminity supports and investment like Facebook and google.<br />
                These days you can build full-blown web or mobile apps as well as real time networking applications like chat and <br />
                video streaming services command-line tools or even games!

            <p>
                Javascript was originally designed to run only in browers.But in 2009 a very clever engineer called Ryan Dahl took the open-source<br />
                JavaScript engine in Chorme and embedded it inside a c++ program language and he called the program Node<br />
                The node is a c++ program that includes Googles's v8 javaScript engine
