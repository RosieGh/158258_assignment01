                        <string>JavaScript</string> is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world right now. It's growing
                        faster than<br />any other programmming language and big companies like Neflix, Walmart and Paypal built internal applications around
                        javaScript.

                    For a long time, javaScript was only used in browsers to build interative web pages but those days are gone<br />
                    because of huge comminity supports and investment like Facebook and google.<br />
                    These days you can build full-blown web or mobile apps as well as real time networking applications like chat and <br />
                    video streaming services command-line tools or even games!

                <p>
                    Javascript was originally designed to run only in browers.But in 2009 a very clever engineer called Ryan Dahl took the open-source<br />
                    JavaScript engine in Chorme and embedded it inside a c++ program language and he called the program Node<br />
                    The node is a c++ program that includes Googles's v8 javaScript engine
